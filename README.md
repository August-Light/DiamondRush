# README

Here's the [introduction of the game](https://august-light.github.io/portfolio/DiamondRush/).

_Version 1_ is the original version of the game I made in 2021. The readability is poor, and the code structure is unclear. However, the whole project can run without major bugs. This was my first complete project built from scratch, and it helped me to learn the basics of the Pygame module.

I'm now working on the _Version 2_ of the game, which will have a refactored code. The new version will be more organized and easy to read, and it will be easier to extend new functions or optimizations.
